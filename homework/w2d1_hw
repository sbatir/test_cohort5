Q.1	 Mark the below algorithms as supervised vs unsupervised?
●	k-means
●	GMM
●	PCA
●	Linear Regression
●	Logistic Regression
●	Decision Tree
●	XGBoost
●	Random Forest

●	 k-means: Unsupervised
●	GMM: Unsupervised
●	PCA: Unsupervised
●	Linear Regression: Supervised
●	Logistic Regression: Supervised
●	Decision Tree: Supervised
●	XGBoost: Supervised
●	Random Forest: Supervised

Q.2	Identify which type of decision tree will you use in the following situations? (Hint: Regression or Classification)
To fit a sine curve with additional noisy observations
To predict the chance of survival of passengers based on passenger attributes given the titanic disaster dataset.

To fit a sine curve with additional noisy observations: Decision Tree - Regression
To predict the chance of survival pf passengers based on passenger attributes given the titanic disaster dataset: Decision Tree - Classification

Q.3	Does Random forest affect bias or variance in any manner in comparison to the decision tree and why?
Random forest reduces variance or overly complex model by using different samples for trees and by building/combining smaller decision trees. Each tree fits or overfits a part of the training set and one can expect the overfitting to partially reduce during the averaging.
Q.4	What kind of hyperplane can you expect from logistic regression and decision tree in the same feature space?
Decision Trees bisect the space into smaller and smaller regions (more complex feature interactions), whereas Logistic Regression fits a single line (linear relationship) to divide the space exactly into two.
